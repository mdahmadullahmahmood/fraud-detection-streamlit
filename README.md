<p align="center">
  <b>An AI-powered fraud detection system using autoencoders for real-time anomaly detection in financial transactions.</b>
</p>

## 📌 Project Overview
This project utilizes **machine learning and deep learning (autoencoders)** to detect fraudulent transactions based on transaction features. It processes **Transaction Amount, Account Balance, Risk Score, and Transaction Type** to identify anomalies. The system includes **real-time alerts** and a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive monitoring.

Traditional fraud detection models rely on rule-based systems that often fail against evolving fraud tactics. This system leverages **unsupervised learning techniques**, allowing it to **detect novel fraud patterns** without requiring labeled fraudulent data. The model continuously improves over time, making it highly effective for real-world financial applications.

## ✨ Features
✔️ Anomaly detection using **autoencoders** 🔍  
✔️ Real-time **fraud detection alerts** 🚨  
✔️ User-friendly **Streamlit dashboard** 🖥️  
✔️ **Scalable and deployable** on cloud ☁️  
✔️ Efficient **feature scaling and encoding** 📊  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- **UI Dashboard:** Streamlit  
- **Alert System:** SMTP Email Notification  

## 📥 Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-fraud-detection.git
cd real-time-fraud-detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the fraud detection system
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Upload transaction data or enter transaction details manually.
2. The system will **process the data and detect anomalies**.
3. If fraudulent activity is detected, **an alert is triggered**.
4. View fraud analysis in the **Streamlit dashboard**.
